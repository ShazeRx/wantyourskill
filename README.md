# Want-Your-Skill

Are you 100k Java Developer but you don't have skills to build simple wordpress site for you startup?
Or maybe you have brilliant skills at UX but simple "hello world" app is too complicated for you?


Goal of this app is to create platform based on S4S model (Skill-for-skill)
* Skill matchmaking option - match people who search for specific skill that you have and in the opposite site
* Edit your profile (including skills)
* Chat with matched people
* Match squads with other squads
* People rating option

Main idea of app is to help IT startups to find people with skill, that they lack of, and of course outsource their skills for the others

App will be created in Django framework
